# DataExplorationProject(SQL)

This project involves the exploration of COVID-19 data using various SQL techniques and functions. The code performs several analyses and calculations on the COVID-19 data.

Analyzes COVID-19 data by examining deaths, total cases, population statistics, and vaccination progress. It filters out records without a specified continent and calculates death percentages for the United States. It also determines infection rates and death counts per population for countries and continents. The project summarizes global COVID-19 numbers and utilizes CTEs, temporary tables, and a view named "PercentPopulationVaccinated" for data analysis and visualization.

Overall, the code explores various aspects of COVID-19 data, such as death rates, infection rates, and vaccination progress, using SQL techniques and functions.
