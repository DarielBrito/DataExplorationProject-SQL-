# DataExplorationProject-SQL-

This project involves the exploration of COVID-19 data using various SQL techniques and functions. The code performs several analyses and calculations on the COVID-19 data, including:

    Retrieving data related to COVID-19 deaths, filtering out records without a continent specified.
    Examining the total cases and total deaths, calculating the percentage of deaths based on the total cases for the United States.
    Analyzing the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 for each location.
    Identifying countries with the highest infection rate compared to their population.
    Determining countries with the highest death count per population.
    Breaking down the data by continent and finding continents with the highest death count per population.
    Summarizing global numbers, including the total cases, total deaths, and death percentage.
    Analyzing the percentage of the population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine by location and date, considering population and new vaccinations data.
    Using common table expressions (CTEs) to perform calculations on the partitioned data from the previous query.
    Utilizing a temporary table to perform calculations on the partitioned data from the previous query.
    Creating a view named "PercentPopulationVaccinated" to store data for later visualizations.

Overall, the code explores various aspects of COVID-19 data, such as death rates, infection rates, and vaccination progress, using SQL techniques and functions.
